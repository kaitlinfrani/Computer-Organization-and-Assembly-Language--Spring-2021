//
//Purpose
//  Scan a contiguous segment of memory from the starting byte to the null character and determine if the string of chars is properly
//  formatted for conversion to a valid float number.  This function, isfloat, does not perform the conversion itself.  That task is
//  is done by a library function such as atof.
//
//Future project
//  Re-write this function in X86 assembly.
//
//How to call isfloat from an X86 function
//  == Declare isfloat to exist in another file: extern isfloat
//  == Obtain an address pointing to starting byte in memory.  Such an address can be a register like rsp.  Also, the address may
//     be provide by the name of an array.   For example, "mystuff resq 300" declares an array of 300 bytes,  The name "mystuff" may
//     be used as the start of block of memory.
//  == Do the setup block for isfloat:
//     == mov rax,0
//     == mov rdi, <a memory location>    such as mov rdi, rsp, or mystuff
//     == call isfloat
//     == The boolean result is returned in rax.  If rax holds exactly 0 then 'false' was returned, otherwise 'true' was returned.

//How to call isfloat from a C function
//  ==Place the prototype near the top of the calling function:  bool isinteger(char []);
//  ==Declare a bool variable:  bool outcome;
//  ==Create an array:  char wonder[200];
//  ==Fill the array with a null-terminate sequence of chars.  Usually this sequence comes from an input device like stdin (keyboard).
//  ==Call the function: outcome = isfloat(wonder)
//  ==Test outcome for true = "It is a float number" or false = "It is not a float number".
